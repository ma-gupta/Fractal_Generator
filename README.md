# Fractal Generator 

Uses C++ code that is rendered using OpenGL and the GLFW framework.
Creates 4 different fractal types (Sierpinski Triangle, Squares and Diamonds, Koch Snowflake, and Dragon Curve) that have interactive feactures via keyboard controls. Each depth of the fractal will display as a different randomly generated color.

## Keyboard Controls
### Change scenes:
-------------
1 Key - Sierpinski Triangle

2 Key - Squares and Diamonds

3 Key - Koch Snowflake

4 Key - Dragon Curve

### Change depths:
-------------
Left Arrow Key - decreases depth down to 0

Right Arrow Key - increases depth up to 6

## Running and Compiling
Running and Compliing of this program will require several third party GLFW libraries (argh- 1.3.1, fmt-7.0.3, glew-2.1.0, glfw-3.3.2, glm-0.9.9.7, vivd-2.2.1)
